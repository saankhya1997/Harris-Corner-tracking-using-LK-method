# Harris-Corner-tracking-using-LK-method

Harris Corners are detected and tracked using Lucas Kanade method for object tracking (optical flow). In the code, I have used a web camera. If you want to play your own video, you can replace the '0' in Video Capture method of cv2 with the path of the video. You can stop the video by the 'Escape' key and clear the tracking in the video by pressing 'c'. Also, if you want to detect new corners, you can reset the program by pressing 'q'.
